# Yakmos
[Not Live Yet](https://github.com/bcwaters/yakmos)

Universal comment box for any url

## Stack
Frontend built with React utilizing bootstrap
Express backend with MongoDb

plans: 

- this will be developed as a chrome extension which embeds the reactApp as an iframe

- Set up a home page which functions similiar to extension. Example: if a user wants to add yakmos comment to their url they simply provide yakmos.com/generatedLink. The generated link returns a iFrame of Url provided with comments overlayed.
- considering going serverless  and setting up the database calls as a microservice with AWS Lamba 

## How to run the server

clone the repo and run ```npm install ```

To run the server use ``` npm run start ```

note: make sure to add something to the mongoDB collection
